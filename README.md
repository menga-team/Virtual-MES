# Virtual-MES
vmes for short, is a simulation of the Menga Entertainment System.

## Installation
We recommend using the [project template](https://github.com/menga-team/MES-Project) alongside with
[mvm](https://github.com/menga-team/mes-version-manager) to integrate simulation into your game
developement workflow. If you want to work with vmes specifically, check out the CMake Setup by trying
out one of the [examples](examples). This should work with the CMake integration of your preferred IDE too.

## Usage
For a tutorial on MES developement or a detailed explanation on MES drivers, check out the
